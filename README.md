# TDMOA-USV

The capability of avoiding collisions in an environment with obstacles is a necessary function for an autonomous unmanned surface vehicle (USV).

We propose a novel multiple obstacles avoidance approach for USVs called the three-dimensional multiple obstacle avoidance (TDMOA) algorithm. This version releases the core implementtation for TDMOA, and we would share more code when prepared due the end of November.
